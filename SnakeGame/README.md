This is a snake game based off of the original concept born in the 1976 game "Blockade."
The player will be using the arrow keys in order to change directions to the left or right, based on their current orientation. 

The player will eat small items in order to grow longer and move faster, until they beat the game at level 100 (99 items consumed). This will unlock a bonus level where the player's only option is to follow the tail of the snake until it leads the head to the last item.
